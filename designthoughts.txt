Mobile App in Corona SDK-Lua 

Based on the coffee app from lectures I decided to do a cafe
using products/categories as Coffees, Teas, Biscuits and Snack Foods

The Name i Chose was Cafe Libre (being based in the liberties i chose Libre)
I also chose the Italian flag colours Red and Green.
For biscuit i chose generic biscuits, also since it was oktoberfest I chose the cafe to serve some southern german/austrian food snacks
